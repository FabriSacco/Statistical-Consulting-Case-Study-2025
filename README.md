## Overview
This repository contains the work produced for the Statistical Consulting Case Study 2025. This work was completed as part of the KU Leuven course *Statistical Consulting*, based on a case study provided by the company Element61. The goal of this project is to develop a Credit-Risk Modelling Toolkit that processes raw start-up and funding data, builds a calibrated probability-of-default model, and provides a fully scored portfolio with policy decisions, drift and fairness analytics, and diagnostic plots.
